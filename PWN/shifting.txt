        shr rdi, 32
        mov al, dil

# In here we wanted to load the 5th least significant byte of rdi into rax.
# rdi = | B7 | B6 | B5 | B4 | B3 | B2 | B1 | B0 |

# So, in this case, we want rax = B4, whatever B4 is.

# We shift B4 to the right (32 bits), then we need to only load that onto
# rax. We only want to load that byte, so we need to load only a small
# part of rdi - ergo, dil
