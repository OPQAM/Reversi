        xor rdi, 1         # I invert this result, because the exercise
        xor rax, rax       # wants me to have 1 in rax for even and 0
        xor rax, rdi       # for odd. So I zero rax and then write (or
			   # not) into it

# Here's my attempt at hacking this program, since it's wanting to compare
# rdi with rax:

#       xor rdi, rdi       # zero rdi (forcing it to be even)
#       xor rax, rax       # zero rax (now I need to invert it)
#       or rax, 1          # forcing it to be 1
