When we first create our breakpoints, they are just small numbers, but as soon as the program starts, these numbers become huge. This is the result of the address being by the OSes (Address Space ayout Randomization, or ASL). Before the program starts, the debugger has no idea of where the program is located within memory.

So, randomized addresses and much bigger addresses are to be expected.
