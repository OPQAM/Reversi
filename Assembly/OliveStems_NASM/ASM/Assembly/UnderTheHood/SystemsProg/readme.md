Following along materials from Intro to Systems Programming course online

gcc -Wall -Wextra -g -std=c11 bitPatterns.c && ./a.out

Explanation:

-> -Wall           (enable all warnings)
-> -Westra         (enable extra warnings)
-> -g              (debugging)
-> -std=c11        (the C version we're running)
-> bitPatterns.c   (the file we're compiling)
-> ./a.out         (run the resulting file)

We could, instead already define the program's name and run that:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -g -std=c11 bitPatterns.c -o bitPatterns && ./bitPatterns

debug.c was copied from a video, to be analyzed.
I added a debugOld.c to keep an original version of the code.
The printed line was 'What even is life?'

Added the folders from the SystemsProg course to the Lectures folder, and added it to .gitignore
