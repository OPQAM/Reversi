#Crack increasingly complex C programs

The idea is to create simple C programs that will increase in difficulty
over time, and to crack them with several tools, documenting it all
while doing it, and then postion on my blog so that others might learn
from it


movabs is an instruction that moves a 64-bit (8-byte) immediate value directly into a 64-bit register. It's used when you need to load a large constant value that won't fit in the 32-bit immediate field of a regular mov instruction..
