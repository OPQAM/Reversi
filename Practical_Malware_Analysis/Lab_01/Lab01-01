# NOTES

- 2 files:
Lab01-01
Lab01-01.dll

1. Match existing antivirus signatures?

### **Virus Total**
(Lab01-01)
- 'This binary is a parasitic file infector. Upon execution with a specific command-line argument ("WARNING_THIS_WILL_DESTROY_YOUR_MACHINE"), it drops a copy of a DLL named "Lab01-01.dll" as "C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll". It then recursively traverses the file system starting from "C:\*", finds all .exe files, and patches their import tables to replace imports from "kernel32.dll" with the malicious "kerne132.dll". This causes infected applications to load the malicious DLL upon launch.'

- Several warnings

2. When were the files compiled?

*To figure this out I can make use of many tools:
- PE-bear / PEview
- CFF Explorer
- Detect It Easy
- Ghidra
- Radare2

Note that timestamps can be faked and many packers zero it.*

CFF Explorer shows in Nt Headers > File Header > TimeDateStamp the value 0x4D0E2FD3, this is basically the number of seconds since 01-01-1970. In this case, 1292775379, around 19 December of 2010.
The .dll shows a similar timestamp.
