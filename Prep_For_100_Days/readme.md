# 100 Days of Code: Creating the LazySuite

## What's This About?

The LazySuite is a personal project where I commit to building a set of Python tools designed to assist in my Reverse Engineering (RE) studies. Over the next 100 days, I will focus on creating, refining, and documenting these tools while also improving my Python programming skills. This project serves as both a learning opportunity and a portfolio to showcase my progress in Python, automation, and low-level programming.

## Objectives

- **Python Practice**: Strengthen my Python fundamentals by applying them to practical, tool-oriented programming.
- **RE Tools**: Develop tools that are relevant to RE tasks, aiming to simplify and automate common workflows.
- **Portfolio Development**: Build a repository of scripts and tools that demonstrate my skills and thought processes.
- **Public Sharing**: Share daily updates on social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Mastodon, GitHub) and weekly blog posts to document progress and insights.

## Why LazySuite?

The LazySuite is named after my philosophy of automating tedious, repetitive tasks. The goal is to create a collection of lightweight, effective scripts that aid RE efforts, even for a beginner. It’s about working smarter, not harder.

## Planned Tools

Here are some of the tools I plan to include in the LazySuite (this is a WIP and can change on a whim):

### Binary Analysis Helpers
- Automate disassembly, symbol extraction, and binary comparisons.

### Debugger Integration
- Scripts to streamline GDB workflows and set up hooks dynamically.

### File Analysis Utilities
- Tools for inspecting file headers, entropy analysis, and metadata extraction.

### Documentation Generators
- Automated report or markdown generation from analysis outputs.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Whether it’s feedback, ideas, or code improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. This project is beginner-friendly, so don’t hesitate to jump in.

## How to Use the LazySuite

Each tool in the LazySuite will include detailed documentation on its usage, purpose, and installation requirements. Check the individual tool directories for more information.
